# Tourism Recommendation and Pathfinding

## The recommendation system
1. On the homepage, users will see a recommendation list, which is a recommendation prediction based on the recommender systemâ€™s ratings of all users and the preferences of current users!

2. The user browses the destinations through the Explore page, they can select a favourite travel destination and click on the picture or text to enter the detail page.

3. The first half part of the detail page is the attraction's information and the rest on the page is a recommend list based on the user's attributes.  Users can perform two operations on this page, which are rating a tourist attraction, and adding it to Path Finder. After the user performs the rating, the recommender system will start to recalcualte the recommend list, and the detail page and homepage will be updated accordingly.
